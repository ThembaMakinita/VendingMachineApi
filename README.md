Vending Machine

The Vending App API is a simple basic rest API, built on the spring boot framework.
The application was designed in a manner that mimics a real life vending machine, where a user would just walk up to the vending machine and select the product they want then pay and get the product they just paid for, as well as the change should there be any applicable.
The application will only sell available products and will return the users money should they try to attempt to buy an item that isnâ€™t available or should they select an unavailable product by mistake.
